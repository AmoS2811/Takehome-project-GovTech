I decided to go for this type of structure as it keeps everything organized and if more components were to be added, i would categorize them even more by making their parent folders feature based. This follows SOC (separation of concerns)-
and makes it easier to find the relevant code when bugs occur. <br />
I also added a frontend folder to seperate the frontend from the backend. There is no backend in this case, but usually there would be for these types of applications as we need to store our client data somewhere.
<br />
# Functionality checklist
[ x ] - For a given webpage, you can embed some JavaScript on that page and several clients will appear in a list <br />
[ x ] - Each client has the following attributes: Full name, which visa(s) they are working towards, their company, and when they were last active on the website <br />
[ x ] - There are sorting toggle buttons ( ▼ ) at the top of the client list that enable you to sort the list by the different fields <br />
<br />
# Things I didnt have time to complete
## Implementing color coding for visa types
 If I had more time I would group the visas into categories and give them colors based on the group they belong to <br />
## Left Align the Client Data and Buttons
This was something I didnt notice until I was developing the sorting functionality, so I was nearly out of time and had to deprioritize this goal as the other goal was more significant to the project
## Using a web Bundler
Given enough time I would gladly learn how to do this and implement it, wasnt viable to do given the time constraint
## Better sort functionality
In an ideal scenario, an attourney could click on the visa type sort button and pick what visa types they wanted to sort by to make their workflow more effective or communicate recent law changes to certain visa types. Unfortunately this was not possible given the time constraints
## Accessibility
There are some accessibility concerns with my solution. I willingly did not factor in screen size or accesibility tools such as screen readers when making this, but IMO if something is customer facing then it should also be universally accessible, maybe not in a startup but later down the line
## Code Reusability
There are certain parts of the code I would move into their own folder. An example of this is moving the sort function into a utils file for reusability and making the buttons a reusable component that takes in props
